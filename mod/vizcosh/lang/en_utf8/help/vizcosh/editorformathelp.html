<h2>Algorithm-Visualization-Format Editor</h2>

<p>
	Here you can create your own algorithm visualization format. It will be available for everyone.
</p>
<p>
	You need to specify a name and optionally a file extension which should be the extension of 
	the files containing algorithm visualization data. Most importantly you need to give a JNLP file 
	template which will be used to create the actual jnlp file which then will be started by the 
	user. A JNLP Template can have variables which will be replaced by the appropriate values:
	<ul>
		<li><strong>JNLP-PATH:</strong> the path to the jnlp-file </li>
		<li><strong>JNLP-FILENAME:</strong> the filename of the jnlp-file</li>
		<li><strong>DATA-PATHFILENAME:</strong> the filename and path to the file containing algorithm visualization data</li>
		<li><strong>DATA-TYPE:</strong> the type of the file containing algorithm visualization data</li>
		<li><strong>JAR-PATH:</strong> the path to the jar-files which will be used by this jnlp</li>
	</ul>
</p>
<p>
	There are three JNLP-templates given which can also be used or edited.
