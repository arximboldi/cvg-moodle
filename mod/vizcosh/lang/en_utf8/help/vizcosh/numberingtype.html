	There are several predefined numbering types:
</p>
<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>None</strong> - chapter and subchapter titles are not formatted at all, use

		title type "A First Chapter", "A.1 Some Subchapter",...
	</li>

	</li>
	<li>
		<strong>Bullets</strong> - subchapters are indented and displayed with bullets.
	</li>
