<h2>Frequently Asked Questions about the VizCoSH module</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
    <strong>Why only two category-levels?</strong><br />
    Two levels are generally enough for all textbooks, three levels would
    lead to poorly structured documents. The VizCoSH module is designed for
    creation of short multipage study materials.

    <strong>Can students edit VizCoSHs?</strong><br />
    Only teachers can create and edit VizCoSHs. There are no plans to implement student editing 
    for textbooks. The main reason is to keep the VizCoSH-module as simple as possible.

    <strong>How do I search the chapters?</strong><br />
    At present there is only one way, use browser's search capability in print page. Global 
    searching is now possible only in Moodle forums.

  	<strong>My titles do not fit on one line.</strong><br />
    Either rephrase your titles or ask your site admin to change TOC width. It is defined 
    globally for all vizcoshs in module configuration page.

		<strong>What exactly is <em>eMargo</em>?</strong><br />
		eMargo supports interactive communication with other participants of a lecture or with its supervisors. When using this feature, users can 
		annotate existing lecture notes in an extra column next to the main text and are able to add comments. <br />
		Teachers are able to disable the eMargo-features in every VizCoSH if the annotation features are not needed.

 		<strong>How can I change the size of the comment-column?</strong><br />
		It is possible to change the height and width of the comment-column on the right side in your global Moodle-administration-area. 
		If you don't have access to it, ask your administrator.
