<h2>Algorithm Visualization Editor</h2>

<p>
	Here you can create your own algorithm visualization. It will be available for everyone.
</p>
<p>
	You need to specify a name, a description and some suitable topics (for searching 
	purposes, optional). Furthermore you need to give a format which specifies how to start 
	the algortihm visualization. You can also add a file which e.g. contains the particular 
	visualization data. Optionally you can define a thumbnail which will be displayed when 
	the algorithm visualization is added to a VizCoSH chapter.
