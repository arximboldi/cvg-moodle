<h2>Chapter editing</h2>

<ul>
	<li>
		<strong>Dividing a chapter into paragraphs:</strong><br />
		<a name="paragraphs"></a>If you would like to use the annotation-features of this module, you have to separate the chapter-text into paragraphs because 
		all annotations are referring to certain paragraphs and not to a chapter as a whole. <br />
		This module can only identify the text-paragraphs if they are saved in a certain format described below. It is neccessary to mark a new paragraph by 
		inserting two <span style="font-family: Courier New;">&lt;br /&gt;</span>-tags. If you press the enter-key, Moodle will add these two tags automatically. 
		To verify that they have been saved correctly, you can press the button in the toolbar above the text that allows you to switch between the WYSIWYG-view and 
		the HTML-sourcecode-view. The HTML-sourcecode to separate paragraphs should look like in the following example:<br />
		<br />
		<code>This is the first paragraph.<br />
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />
			And the second paragraph follows right here.<br />
			&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;<br />
			Paragraph No. 3 is the end, my friend ;-).</code>

		<strong>Chapter Titles</strong><br />
		Try to keep the chapter titles short (they have to fit into the table of contents).

	<li>
		<strong>Subchapters</strong><br />
		The maximum level of subchapters is two.

		<strong>Problems using the HTML-Editor?</strong><br />
		If you have encountered problems when using Moodle's WYSIWYG-html-editor, try switching to another 
		browser (such as Mozilla Firefox) or turn off the editor completely in your user-profile.
