	* ChangeLog: Started changelog file.

	* addvis.php, createjnlp.php, install.xml, editorvis.php,
	editorvis.html: Changed the way author and format are stored in
	the visualizations table so they refer to the primary key instead
	to a volatile and non-unique name. This broke the search
	functionality.

	* editorvis.php: Code cleanup. Added translation extensions.
