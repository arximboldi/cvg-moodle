The current design of Vizcosh has a flaw that goes against the Moodle
system: the Vizcosh, being an a activity module, creates multi-course
data. This is a big problem when exporting the course, and very dirty
hacks had to be made to workarround this problem.

The best solution, from my personal point of view, is to completely
get rid of the vizcosh_vizalgos and vizcosh_formats tables, that only
create problems and the corresponding editing forms are by no means
intuitives, specially the format editor.

The we can easily get rid of the vizcosh_vizalgos using the local
course storage to store the files. Then, then, we can use the 'filter'
aproximation that we used for the XAAL algorithms to inser the
vizalgos, or even just include a link, that can be wrapped by the user
into an image or whaever he feels like if he wants to have a preview
or something.

The formats, as they are not user-friendly to edit at all, can be
provided in any way by the means of "plugins" made of PHP functions
(simple ones, that can be even edited by non-programmers!) stored in
$VIZCOSH_ROOTS/formats.
